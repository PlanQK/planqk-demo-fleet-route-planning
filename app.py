description = """
    This demo shows how to use the PlanQK Platform to solve a simple quantum route planning problem. The problem 
    is to find the shortest route between two points on a grid. The grid is represented by a graph, where each 
    node is a point on the grid and each edge is a connection between two points. The graph is given as an 
    adjacency matrix. The quantum algorithm is based on the Grover algorithm. The algorithm is implemented as a 
    service on the PlanQK Platform. The demo uses the service to solve the route planning problem.
